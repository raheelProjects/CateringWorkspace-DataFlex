Class:
    df.WebMenuGroup
Extends:
    df.WebObject
Mixins:
    df.WebMenuProvider_mixin

This class represents the WebMenuGroup which is a provider class for the menu system. This means 
that it providers menu items to listeners of the menu system that render the menu. The WebMenuGroup 
is only a provider so it doesn�t render anything and is used to place menu�s in a separate place as 
where they are rendered. It has special logic so that if it is placed inside a view it will 
deactivate itself (unregister from the menu hub) if the view is not visible.
